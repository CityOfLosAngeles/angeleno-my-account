## What is an Angeleno Account?
An Angeleno Account acts as a single sign-on for our public to access multiple City of Los Angeles services that have integrated Angeleno Account SSO login. 

## What is this Repository (Angeleno - My Account)?
This repository is a Flutter based web-app that interfaces with Auth0 to handle user authentication and allows users to edit their Angeleno Account profile and their account security via multi-factor authentication.

## Getting Started
The development branch is our main branch you can use to work on your own work/issues. To start development you'll `git clone` this repo; after cloning you'll by default be on the development branch. When opening the pull request for your work, make sure the branch is being merged into `development` branch as well.

### Minimum Requirements
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) >= 3.16.0
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite)
- [Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com/)
  - Create Project and enable the following APIs:
    - [Places Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/autocomplete) 
    - [Places Details](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details)
    - [Service Usage](https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/overview)
    - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - [Cloud Resource Manager](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager)
    - [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/secret-manager) 
    - [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute)
      
- [Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started)
  - Create 2 Auth0 Apps:
    - Single Page App for authenticating sessions used for the Flutter Auth0Web library
    - Regular Web App for handling transactions with Auth0's API's (MFA, password changes, and writing user updates to Auth0)   


## Development

### Flutter Environment
After downloading the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), you'll be able to run
`flutter doctor` which will give you details on anything you need to develop the application. As this app is only web-based for now you can safely ignore warnings around developing for Windows, Android, iOS, etc.

Making updates to `.dart` files will require you to run `flutter build web` so that the web app can recompile.

After building, you can use `flutter run -d chrome` to run on Chrome. You can add additional devices (browsers) for cross-browser testing.

If you need to specify a web port to run the app on, you can append the argument `--web-port=####` to the above - this will be helpful when testing redirects from external apps as it'll allow us to control a designated port.

In order for the code to pick your environment variables, you'll have to append `--dart-define-from-file=.env` to your flutter run command.

On windows, you can run `.\tests.bat`, which will run both `dart analyze` to check linting and `flutter test` to run unit tests.

### Local Development
Rename the `.env-example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

In Auth0, you'll want to create a Single Page Application to get the appropriate values for the `.env` file.

If you're using a cloud function without authorization, you will not need the Service Account variables, but the code will have to be modified.

The cloud functions being used can be found in the `functions` directory. To run them locally, you can find instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/local-emulator). Once you have the functions running locally, you'll have to update the code in the locations (e.g. [here](/lib/controllers/api_implementation.dart#L88)) where the request is sent so that it points to your emulator.

#### Commands
Needed for running project:
- flutter run -d chrome --web-port=#### --dart-define-from-file=.env
- firebase emulators:start --only functions

Needed for syntax:
- dart analyze

Needed for running Unit Tests:
- flutter test
